REFLECT: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?

It creates a hidden directory called .git.  The commit data needs a place to be
stored.


REFLECT: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It can contain a subset of files in the working directory.


REFLECT: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Run git diff --staged to compare the changes in the staging area to the master
commit.


REFLECT: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

When you make one or more experimental changes branches would help by 
keeping the changes logically separate.


REFLECT: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They show where branches occurred and which commits are reachable by any head.


REFLECT: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we 
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The changes from both branches are automatically merged together.  The new 
commit has 2 parents.


REFLECT: What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing 
merges manually?

Automatic merging works well.  Doing the manual merge, I broke the game.  I 
committed before testing, and the class hasn't taught us how to undo a merge.  
I don't know how to go back and try again.  I haven't learned java script yet, 
and I don't know how to debug a website yet, so I'm not getting any error 
messages. I just have a blank webpage.  I hope the class doesn't assume all 
went well.
