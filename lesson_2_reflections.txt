REFLECT: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?

It creates a hidden directory called .git.  The commit data needs a place to be
stored.


REFLECT: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It can contain a subset of files in the working directory.


REFLECT: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Run git diff --staged to compare the changes in the staging area to the master
commit.
