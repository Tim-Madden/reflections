REFLECT: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?

It creates a hidden directory called .git.  The commit data needs a place to be
stored.


REFLECT: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

It can contain a subset of files in the working directory.


REFLECT: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Run git diff --staged to compare the changes in the staging area to the master
commit.

REFLECT: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping 
your history organized? How would branches help?

When you make one or more experimental changes branches would help by 
keeping the changes logically separate.
