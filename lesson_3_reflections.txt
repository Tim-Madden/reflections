REFLECT: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote repository could back up your repository in cases of hardware 
  malfunction or theft.  You might
  want to share with others.  Others might want to share with you.


REFLECT: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may not want to pull someone elses work without reviewing it.


REFLECT: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I would fork someone elses work if they permitted me to copy and make changes to it.  I would clone a repository to bring it from GitHub to my PC.  I would branch to try out a major change or different mode.

REFLECT: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

(I copied this one from instructor) 
If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.
