When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?
  A remote repository could back up your repository in cases of hardware 
  malfunction or theft.  You might
  want to share with others.  Others might want to share with you.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I may not want to pull someone elses work without reviewing it.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and 
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  I would fork someone elses work if they permitted me to copy and make changes 
  to it.  I would clone a repository to bring it from GitHub to my PC.  I would 
  branch to try out a major change or different mode.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

  (I copied this one from instructor) 
  If I am about to go without Internet access for a while, for example to work
  on a plane, I can update my local copy before I leave.  I can do this even
  if I'm not ready to merge those changes into my own branches yet.  Then if I
  want, I can perform the merge while offline, or I need to know what the
  remote version is at some point, I have an easy way to access it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I would use a shared drive and keep copies of dated files.  This would be 
  easier to learn, but create more clutter.  Conflicts would not be handled
  at all.
